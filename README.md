# Ping-pong-game

For my last project at GA I decided to learn python and specifically and library. I decided on building the classic ping pong game using a library Called Kivy. 

## Installation

I do not have this project deployed anywhere...yet. The configuration process for android was a little tricky, but maybe I'll get there eventually. 

If you would like to try this out just clone/fork the repo and go at it.
